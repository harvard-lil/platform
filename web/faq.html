<h1>LibraryCloud FAQ</h1>
<br />

<h2>What is LibraryCloud?</h2>

<p>LibraryCloud is a metadaserver. It makes information about the content and usage of Harvard Library items available for use by applications developed by anyone.</p>

<h2>What sort of metadata does it make available?</h2>

<p>Initially we are making available catalog information about 12.3M items in the Harvard Library collection. (We are required to hold back metadata about a fractional percentage of that collection because of license restrictions.) We hope soon to make available information about the usage of those items &mdash; what we call "event" data &mdash; including times checked out, times put on reserve, times called back early, etc.</p>

<h2>Why? What's the point?</h2>

<p>The aim is to enable and encourage the development of innovative software applications that put this rich library metadata to use.</p>

<h2>For example?</h2>

<p>One good example is <a href="http://stacklife.harvard.edu">StackLife</a> (which started out life under the name "ShelfLife"). It lets you browse a library electronically, showing shelves of books and other items heat-mapped based upon their patterns of usage by library patrons. LibraryCloud also enables library analytics, social networking around library items, recommendation engines, timelines, and any other applications developers can dream up.</p>

<h2>What restrictions are there on the use of this metadata?</h2>

<p>Item metadata contributed by Harvard University is offered under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons 0</a> license. While the data is freely available for use, the Harvard Library community norms request attribution and that if others improve this data, they make those improvements equally freely available.  In addition, for data that originated in WorldCat, at OCLCâ€™s request, we are asking users to observe the WorldCat <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/policy/odcbynorms.htm">community norms</a>.  We believe that observing these community norms will help promote good practices, foster trust among partners, and encourage growth of the open metadata community.</p>
                                <p>The API is not intended to be used to acquire Harvard data sets in their entirety. Not only is that an inefficient way to gather the data, it can also have an adverse affect on the performance of the API for others. Note also that the data sets are available for bulk download here: <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata">http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata</a>.</p>
<p>This API and its infrastructure are in alpha, and is not intended to support external applications at production levels. If you need to hit the API hard please contact us first.</p>

<h2>How does an end-user use LibraryCloud?</h2>

<p>Indirectly. LibraryCloud provides only API access, which means if onlly provides data to software applications.  </p>

<h2>How does this fit in with Harvard's Open Metadata initiative?</h2>

<p>Nicely. The <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/">Harvard Open Metadata</a> initiative opened up the Harvard Library catalog metadata for public access under a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons 0 (public domain) license</a>. That metadata is available for bulk download here <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata">http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata</a>. LibraryCloud is now the place to go to get API access to the latest version of this data. The original API access was provided by the Digital Public Library of America at <a href="http://api.dp.la/v0.03/item/">http://api.dp.la/v0.03/item/</a>. That site will remain accessible, but neither the data nor the API is being updated there. </p>

<h2>How does this fit with the Digital Public Library of America?</h2>

<p>Well. The DPLA provided the initial site for API access to the Harvard catalog data. That access is being kept available, but neither the metadata nor the API is being updated. The DPLA is designing its own API, which we are tracking closely. The Library Innovation Lab, which is responsible for LibraryCloud's development at this point also did the original development of the DPLA's API platform, so any similarities are not entirely accidental. Over time we hope to support access to Harvard Library's metadata through the DPLA as well as through LibraryCloud.</p>

<h2>How does this fit with LibraryCloud.org?</h2>

<p>Interestingly. The Library Innovation Lab began a project in 2010 to aggregate metadata from multiple libraries, and to make that metadata openly available through APIs. A group of libraries came together to work on this, and some contributed metadata. We have shifted tactics a bit, though. We are building LibraryCloud first as a platform for metadata from the 73 libraries that make up the Harvard Library, but we are still <em>very</em> interested in bringing in data from other libraries, and making that data openly available, as per the original LibraryCloud vision. We hope to make progeress with this very soon. If you'd like to participate, please let us know contact David Weinberger at self@evident.com.</p>

<h2>What about this "Library Innovation Lab" you keep referring to?</h2>

<p>The Lab is a small group of developers at the Harvard Law Library who work fulltime on creating useful and provocative tools for libraries. There's more <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Does LibraryCloud violate anyone's privacy?</h2>

<p>We work within a strict and thoughtful privacy policy devised in consultation with Harvard security experts and the Library community.</p>
