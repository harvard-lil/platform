<h1>LibraryCloud Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>LibraryCloud may collect limited, anonymous information from site visitors in order to measure site activity and improve the usefulness of our site. The usage information we collect may include IP address, browser type, operating system, screen size and resolution, date and time of visit, search engine and search terms, and IP address of referring page. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. We do not link any of the above information to any personal identifiers.</p>

<p>Some of our software services and sites make use of third party services that may collect IP addresses and set cookies. Those users who do not wish to expose any personal information should consider using anonymizing services where possible.</p>

<h2>Disclosure to third parties</h2>

<p>Available log records, and all stored data may be accessed by our system administrators. The system administrators may produce these records and data to the Administrative Dean, Dean of Students, or the Administrative Board, upon request or suspected violation of our terms of use. It is Harvard's policy to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of unlawful activity. If we receive a warrant or subpoena for user information, we may disclose requested records to law enforcement authorities or outside parties seeking information through the legal process.</p>

<p>In the event that we are required by law (including a court order) to disclose the information you submit, we will provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made so that you may object to the disclosure. We will send this notice by email to the address you have given us. We prefer to independently object to over-broad requests for access to information about users of our site, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this in all cases. If you do not challenge the disclosure request yourself, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>

<h2>Links to independent sites</h2>

<p>LibraryCloud may link to sites outside of the harvard.edu domain. The Lab is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such sites.</p>

<h2>LibraryCloud and third parties</h2>

<p>As is true for many Web sites, LibraryCloud uses a number of third party sites for services and content. When LibraryCloud makes a request to those services, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used by virtually all Web sites  automatically includes the IP address of the user's machine. </p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>LibraryCloud is intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years old. </p>
